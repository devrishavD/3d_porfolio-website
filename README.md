# 3D Portfolio Website

This project is a 3D portfolio website built with React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Three.js. It showcases a dynamic, interactive 3D environment where users can explore various sections of my portfolio in a visually engaging way.

The website features a 3D island model, 'Fox's Islands,' rendered using Three.js and animated with React Spring. A unique contact form triggers animations based on user interactions, enhancing the user experience.
